**Description:**

This code implements a set of algorithms to solve for the thermodynamic stability of clathrate hydrates. This code is motivated by the executable program [CSMGem][1] and its foundational work published in the scientific literature ([Ballard and Sloan, 2002][2],[Jaeger et al, 2003][3],[Ballard and Sloan, 2004][4], [Ballard thesis][5]). It is intended to be a useful tool for the scientific community towards the progress of dynamic, fluid and heat flow models for mixed hydrates (i.e., multiple gas components). To that end, we hope to couple this code to numerical models using computationally inexpensive lookup tables.

This work is the product of [Kristopher N. Darnell][6] and is still a work in progress. This python version of the code is under development.
